 This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize and analyze HR data to derive insights into the employee base. The key goals were to:

-Provide analysis of employee distribution across business units and roles
-Identify trends in demographics like age, gender, education level
-Evaluate employee satisfaction and engagement metrics
-Analyze factors related to employee attrition and turnover
-Enable data-driven decision making around HR initiatives
